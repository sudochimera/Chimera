To mine Chimera follow the instructions below.

Instructions for mining Chimera (CMRA):

Generate a wallet with the electron Linux or Windows wallet. 

https://github.com/Chimera-Project/chimera-wallet-electron/releases

You'll mine to that public address.

Then download xmr-stak from the official fireice github site according to your mining hardware:

CPU Windows miner:
https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/releases/download/1.0.4-rx/xmr-stak-rx-win64-1.0.4.zip

CPU Linux miner:
https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/releases/download/1.0.4-rx/xmr-stak-rx-linux-1.0.4-cpu.tar.xz

NVidia GPU Linux miner:
https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/releases/download/1.0.4-rx/xmr-stak-rx-linux-1.0.4-cpu_cuda-nvidia.tar.xz

AMD GPU Linux miner:
https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/releases/download/1.0.4-rx/xmr-stak-rx-linux-1.0.4-cpu_opencl-amd.tar.xz

and select turtlecoin algorithm. You'll then use the mining address of :

http://54.172.240.25:3333/

When prompted enter your public cmra address. 

You can monitor your mining by visiting
http://54.172.240.25/

And looking at worker stats, enter your public address in the appropriate field.

FYI, I recommend using xmr-stak for mining instead of the simple miner included with the cmra node client which is buggy.

You can also rent hashing power at https://www.miningrigrentals.com/ and select rigs mining cryptonote turtlecoin v2 algo.
